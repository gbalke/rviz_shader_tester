# rviz_shader_tester
Creates a triangle marker with a gradient.

The goal is to make the gradient pull from a texture map instead of the default grayscale. This 
will enable complex coloring of markers.

### Testing
If you'd like to test this, make sure to copy `texture.png` into `/tmp` so that RViz can find it. Alternatively update the absolute path to match the file location within your system.
